# **Next-Gen Smart Wearable Device for Women and Children‚Äôs Safety Using Edge AI**
#### The safety of women and children remains a critical concern, especially in emergency situations where conventional solutions fail due to manual dependency and poor connectivity. Existing safety apps and wearables often require user action to maintain a stable Internet, making them unreliable during actual threats. This project introduces a next-generation smart wearable device powered by edge AI that can autonomously detect danger and respond instantly, even in offline environments.The system continuously listens for distress keywords such as ‚Äôhelp‚Äô or ‚Äôemergency‚Äô using a lightweight on-device AI model. It also monitors vital signs such as heart rate and SpO2 in real time using the MAX30102 sensor. When a threat is detected through voice or abnormal biometrics‚Äîthe device automatically sends an emergency alert containing the GPS location to trusted contacts. To overcome network limitations, it uses LoRa for long-distance communication, ZigBee for local mesh networking, and Bluetooth for short-range alerts. Machine learning algorithms personalize response thresholds to reduce false alarms and improve reliability. Field testing confirmed that the device accurately detects emergencies and transmits alerts in seconds,even in rural, low-signal environments. Designed to be compact, affordable, and self-sufficient, this wearable offers a powerful offline safety solution that bridges the technological gap in personal protection for vulnerable communities

- **Signal Detection & Recognition**: The AI monitors for distress signals, such as keywords or abnormal sounds, and processes the incoming data to identify potential danger.

- **Alert & Location Transmission**: Once a threat is detected, the IoT system triggers real-time alerts with precise location information, immediately sending them to pre-configured emergency contacts or authorities.

- **Response & Support**: Emergency contacts or authorities receive the alert and take action, while the system continues to provide support to ensure timely help in critical situations.


## **Tech Stack**
#### This project leverages a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect distress signals, such as specific keywords or abnormal sounds. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, including sensors like microphones and GPS modules, enable real-time data collection and communication with emergency contacts.
#### Accurate geolocation is provided by GPS modules like the u-blox ZED-F9P, ensuring precise location tracking during emergencies. Embedded systems, such as Raspberry Pi, process the incoming data and run AI algorithms. 
#### Wireless technologies, including GSM, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, facilitate the transmission of real-time alerts to predefined emergency contacts. The solution also leverages cloud services (e.g., AWS, Databricks) for scalable data storage, processing, and analytics. 
#### Python and other programming languages are used for developing machine learning models, software algorithms, and system integration. NoSQL and SQL databases store crucial data securely, while encryption and authentication mechanisms ensure data privacy. Additionally, display modules like 16x2 LCDs visually provide alerts and system status to users, creating a comprehensive and efficient system for women‚Äôs safety.
