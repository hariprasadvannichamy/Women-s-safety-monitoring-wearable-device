# **Women's Safety Monitoring Wearable Device**
#### This project aims to enhance womenâ€™s safety using an AI-powered solution. It combines AI to detect distress signals like "help" or abnormal sounds, with IoT to trigger real-time alerts. These alerts include location details and are sent to emergency contacts or authorities. The goal is to provide a reliable, user-friendly tool that empowers women to get timely help in critical situations, improving personal safety and societal well-being.

### **key Features:**
- AI-Based Distress Detection: Recognizes distress signals like specific keywords ("help") or unusual sounds.
- Real-Time Alerts: Sends instant notifications to emergency contacts with precise location details.
- Geolocation Integration: Ensures accurate tracking of the user's location for a quick response.
- Customizable Settings: Users can configure emergency contacts and personalize alert triggers.
- Seamless Operation: Designed for effortless use as a wearable or software-based solution.
