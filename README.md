Women's Safety Monitoring Wearable Device  

## What‚Äôs This About?  
Imagine having a companion that‚Äôs always there for you, especially in times of need. Our Women's Safety Monitoring Wearable Device is built with AI to provide peace of mind and a helping hand when it matters the most.  

This device listens for distress, detects emergencies, and instantly alerts your trusted contacts with your location and context. It‚Äôs like a smart, wearable safety net.  

## What Makes It Special?  
- Voice-Triggered Alerts: Just say "help" or "emergency," and the device gets to work.  
- Smart Audio Analysis: AI detects abnormal sounds and keywords to identify danger.  
- Location Tracking: Real-time GPS coordinates with detailed addresses.  
- Instant Alerts: Sends emergency SMS with your details to your chosen contacts.  
- Wearable Convenience: Fits into your daily life like a smartwatch.  

##  What‚Äôs Inside?  
### Software:  
- *AI Intelligence*: Powered by TensorFlow Lite for quick and accurate audio classification.  
- *Real-Time Communication*: Using Twilio for SMS and OpenCage for geocoding.  
- *Speech Recognition*: Vosk helps the device understand what‚Äôs being said.  

### Hardware:  
- *ESP32 Microcontroller*: Heart of the device, connecting everything together.  
- *GPS Module*: Pinpoints your exact location.  
- *Microphone**: High-sensitivity mic for clear audio detection.  
- *Display Screen**: Shows alerts, statuses, and updates at a glance.  

## How to Get Started?  
### Requirements:  
- A computer with Python 3.x installed.  
- An ESP32 microcontroller.  
- A GPS module and microphone.
