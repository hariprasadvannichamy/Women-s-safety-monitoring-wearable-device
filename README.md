# **Next-Gen Smart Wearable Device for Women and Children‚Äôs Safety Using Edge AI**
#### The safety of women and children remains a critical concern, especially in emergency situations where conventional solutions fail due to manual dependency and poor connectivity. Existing safety apps and wearables often require user action to maintain a stable Internet, making them unreliable during actual threats. This project introduces a next-generation smart wearable device powered by edge AI that can autonomously detect danger and respond instantly, even in offline environments.The system continuously listens for distress keywords such as ‚Äôhelp‚Äô or ‚Äôemergency‚Äô using a lightweight on-device AI model. It also monitors vital signs such as heart rate and SpO2 in real time using the MAX30102 sensor. When a threat is detected through voice or abnormal biometrics‚Äîthe device automatically sends an emergency alert containing the GPS location to trusted contacts. To overcome network limitations, it uses LoRa for long-distance communication, ZigBee for local mesh networking, and Bluetooth for short-range alerts. Machine learning algorithms personalize response thresholds to reduce false alarms and improve reliability. Field testing confirmed that the device accurately detects emergencies and transmits alerts in seconds,even in rural, low-signal environments. Designed to be compact, affordable, and self-sufficient, this wearable offers a powerful offline safety solution that bridges the technological gap in personal protection for vulnerable communities

### üîç Workflow Explanation

1. **Input: Voice & Health Metrics**  
   The wearable continuously captures audio (voice commands like "help") and vital signs such as heart rate and SpO‚ÇÇ.

2. **AI Analysis using RISC-V Processor**  
   - Detects distress through **voice pattern recognition**  
   - Identifies abnormalities in **health metrics**  

3. **Emergency Detection**  
   - If an emergency is detected, the system triggers the alert mechanism.  
   - If no emergency is found, the device continues monitoring passively.

4. **Trigger Alert & GPS Fetch**  
   - The device retrieves the user's current location using the **GPS module**.

5. **Send Alert via Communication Modules**  
   - Sends an SMS or alert containing the location via **GSM**, **Wi-Fi**, or **LoRa**, depending on availability.

6. **Log Event & Resume Monitoring**  
   - The alert is logged.
   - The system returns to monitoring state for continuous protection.
