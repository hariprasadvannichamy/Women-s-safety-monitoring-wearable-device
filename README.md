# **Next-Gen Smart Wearable Device for Women and
 Children’s Safety Using Edge AI**
#### This project aims to enhance women’s safety using an AI-powered solution. It combines AI to detect distress signals like "help" or abnormal sounds, with IoT to trigger real-time alerts. These alerts include location details and are sent to emergency contacts or authorities. The goal is to provide a reliable, user-friendly tool that empowers women to get timely help in critical situations, improving personal safety and societal well-being.

## **key Features:**
- AI-Based Distress Detection: Recognizes distress signals like specific keywords ("help") or unusual sounds.
- Real-Time Alerts: Sends instant notifications to emergency contacts with precise location details.
- Geolocation Integration: Ensures accurate tracking of the user's location for a quick response.
- Customizable Settings: Users can configure emergency contacts and personalize alert triggers.
- Seamless Operation: Designed for effortless use as a wearable or software-based solution.

- **Signal Detection & Recognition**: The AI monitors for distress signals, such as keywords or abnormal sounds, and processes the incoming data to identify potential danger.

- **Alert & Location Transmission**: Once a threat is detected, the IoT system triggers real-time alerts with precise location information, immediately sending them to pre-configured emergency contacts or authorities.

- **Response & Support**: Emergency contacts or authorities receive the alert and take action, while the system continues to provide support to ensure timely help in critical situations.


## **Tech Stack**
#### This project leverages a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect distress signals, such as specific keywords or abnormal sounds. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, including sensors like microphones and GPS modules, enable real-time data collection and communication with emergency contacts.
#### Accurate geolocation is provided by GPS modules like the u-blox ZED-F9P, ensuring precise location tracking during emergencies. Embedded systems, such as Raspberry Pi, process the incoming data and run AI algorithms. 
#### Wireless technologies, including GSM, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, facilitate the transmission of real-time alerts to predefined emergency contacts. The solution also leverages cloud services (e.g., AWS, Databricks) for scalable data storage, processing, and analytics. 
#### Python and other programming languages are used for developing machine learning models, software algorithms, and system integration. NoSQL and SQL databases store crucial data securely, while encryption and authentication mechanisms ensure data privacy. Additionally, display modules like 16x2 LCDs visually provide alerts and system status to users, creating a comprehensive and efficient system for women’s safety.
