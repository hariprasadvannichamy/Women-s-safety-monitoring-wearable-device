# **Women's Safety Monitoring Wearable Device**
#### This project is dedicated to enhancing women's safety by developing an innovative AI-powered solution. It combines the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide a reliable and effective response system in emergency situations.

The AI component is designed to recognize distress signals, including specific keywords like "help," or detect abnormal sounds that may indicate a threat. Once a potential danger is identified, the IoT framework ensures that real-time alerts are triggered. These alerts include precise location details and are immediately sent to pre-configured emergency contacts or authorities.
By integrating cutting-edge technologies, this project aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly solution that not only enhances personal safety but also empowers women with a tool to ensure timely help in critical situations. It strives to make a meaningful impact on improving the quality of life and contributing to societal well-being.
